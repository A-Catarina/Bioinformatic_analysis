# Bioinformatic_analysis
This work objective was to implement a bioinformatic pipeline of biological sequences analysis comprising:
  - Sequence import
  - Blast (given a reference sequence and a data base finds the most similar sequences)
  - Multiple Alignment
  - Phylogenetic Tree Construction
  - Graph Construction
  
This tasks were accomplished by the implementation of a set of classes, included on the repository, in Python.

The execution of the task itself is implemented on the run_me.py file.
